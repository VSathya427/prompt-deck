# ðŸ“Š PromptDeck  
_Automated AI-Powered Presentation Generator_

## ðŸš€ Overview
**PromptDeck** is a framework that auto-generates beautiful HTML presentations from structured prompts.  
It leverages **Impress.js** for transitions and **Next.js** for serving interactive decks, while enforcing accessibility and design constraints to ensure professional, readable slides every time.

The goal: **turn prompts into production-ready slide decks** with minimal manual effort.

## âœ¨ Features Implemented (so far)

- ðŸ”¹ **Automated Deck Creation**
  - Converts structured prompts into fully themed HTML slides.  
  - Each deck enforces a consistent theme, font, and style.

- ðŸ”¹ **Impress.js Integration**
  - Adds smooth 3D transitions and navigation controls.  
  - User flow: deck only advances after pressing `Enter` (no auto-redirects).  

- ðŸ”¹ **Next.js Component Orchestration**
  - Sandboxes AI-generated decks into cohesive Next.js components.  
  - Prevents slide overlays and layout bugs by enforcing clean DOM structure.

- ðŸ”¹ **Accessibility & Readability Fixes**
  - Ensures text never renders white-on-white.  
  - Normalizes bullet-point formatting (no redundant numbered lists).  

- ðŸ”¹ **Task-Summary Prompting**
